# SplicerPong
A community-owned fan game owned by the community of the SoulSplicers NFT project

### Project goals
The main goal of this project is to explore game development together and hopefully create something small but fun, web3 integrated and SoulSplicer related.

### Technology
To kick things off the project will be started in the Godot game engine, written in GDScript, using GitHub for version control. If there is desire to move to a different stack we can certainly go in a different way. The reason I chose this stack is because it is very light and easy to get started.

### Project outline
We will use the all-time classic Pong game as a template build a SoulSplicer-themed, multiplayer, web3 version of it. We might even do some interesting spins on the gameplay along the way.

### Roadmap
* Getting started - start with a very basic outline for the game - simple paddles + ball
* Adding AI oponent
* Adding UI
* Adding some graphics
* Adding simple multiplayer support
* Using splicers in the game - hopefully getting some animations from the SoulCreator
* Web3 integration - use YOUR splicer in the game
* Player profile, matchmaking
* ...
